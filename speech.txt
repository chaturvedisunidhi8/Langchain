Good morning everyone,

It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the power of technology in shaping our future. 
From artificial intelligence to renewable energy, we are living in an era of rapid innovation. 

But with great power comes great responsibility. 
We must ensure that technology is used not only to make our lives easier, but also to create a fairer and more sustainable world. 

Thank you.
